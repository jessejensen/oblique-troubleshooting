Question your assumptions!
If only there were a log file...
Have you ever seen this before?
Why is this important?
Is there a better metaphor?
Think backward...
Is it a bug?
When does it happen?
Who saw it first?
Does it replicate? Really?
Are you looking at the right level?
What if? Why not?
State the problem in words as clearly as possible.
What would your hero do?
Pretend that it's fixed now. How did you do it?
Is there something missing?
Discover your formulas and abandon them.
Retrace your steps.
Make an exhaustive list of everything you might do and do the last thing on the list.
Tidy up.
Reboot!
What mistakes did you make last time?
What would you never do?
Do something else for a while.
Ask advice from your opposite.
Escalate?
The map is not the territory.
